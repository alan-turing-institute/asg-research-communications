## Communication Channels

We will use four channels for communication regarding the white papers:

1. **GitHub repo/project ([&sect;](#github-repos-and-projects))**: Project co√∂rdination, tasks, milestones
   - ‚õ≤Ô∏è This repo are **_public_**
   - Repos linked above, under [&sect;&nbsp;Resources](#resources)
   - [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/10/)
1. **Slack**: general day-to-day communications
   - üîê Access to all of Turing by default; external contributors by invitation
   - Main channel: [#asg-white-papers](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/asg-white-papers)
   - Individual channels linked above, under [&sect;&nbsp;Resources](#resources)
1. **Overleaf ([&sect;](#overleaf))**: Authoring platform (links above, under [&sect;&nbsp;Resources](#resources))
   - üöß Access is by invitation
1. **E-mail**: periodic updates by ASG Community Manager [[Achintya Rao](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics)]

### Overleaf

A few pointers:

- Each section of the document sits in a separate file (can be found on the left side in Overleaf).
  The sections are **for guidance only** and can be changed as needed.
  Please feel free to edit the document and add/change sections.
- Each section is contained in a **markdown** file.
  It‚Äôs mostly plain text with a little markup for bold, italics, links, bullets etc.
  No fancy $\LaTeX$ required.
  Please contact [Achintya Rao](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics) if you need help with formatting.
- For the sake of meaningful `diff`s between versions of the document, please start a new sentence on a new line.
  This practice is sometimes called using ‚Äúsemantic line breaks‚Äù.
  Find out more: <https://sembr.org/>.
- Overleaf offers commenting and change-tracking (latter is not active by default).
  Highlighting any text in the source file gives you an option to add a comment.
- Every time you save the file, it recompiles the PDF.
