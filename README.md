# AI for Science and Government (ASG) Communications Outputs project

Welcome to the GitHub repository linking communications outputs developed to communicate about the research projects, outcomes and real-world impact from the [AI for Science and Government (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) research programmes. üéâ

ASG was an integrated research programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) that aims to demonstrate ‚Äì via a diverse range of activities organized and presented as an integrated whole ‚Äì how AI and data science can be used to effectively address significant societal challenges and transform health, science, engineering, and government.
The project

The communications outputs listed in this repository were develped with the contributions from the researchers, showcasing their work through a series of white papers and supporting communication outputs about the ASG projects.

## Vision

‚Äú_Demonstrate, showcase and amplify the real-world impact of ASG research._‚Äù

### Mission

Our goal is to produce a series of communication outputs, including formal reports as well as impact stories, highlighting:
 
- the research contribution of the ASG programme,
- the unique role ASG plays in cultivating diverse endeavours and
- the influence of the Turing‚Äôs network-convening capability ASG's work.

Specifically, the outputs address these questions:

1. What are the ASG research contributions and success stories?
1. Why ASG is uniquely placed to do such integrated research?
1. How does the Turing leverage the convening capability to enhance the quality of ASG work?
1. What is the real-world impact of the ASG research?
 
### Background

ASG was initiated in 2018 with a ¬£38.8M investment from the UK government's strategic priorities fund.
ASG supported a range of projects in different domain areas including applications within the Criminal Justice System, Health, Data Science for Science, Engineering, and Urban Analytics.
In addition to these themes, ASG researchers also worked across three large cross-theme projects that focus on:

- [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience): improving policy-making by linking healthcare and economic data and models, preparing for future shocks and making government more resilient
- [Ecosystems of Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ecosystems-digital-twins): combining methodology from Engineering and Urban Analytics to develop integrated systems of digital twins
- [Environment and Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environment-and-sustainability): linking heterogeneous environmental data and models to help assess the widespread impact of climate change, from arctic sea ice loss to food security

**The project was wrapped up in March 2023.**

## Outputs from this project

In this project, we are providing links to a series of communication outputs.
These address key issues for researchers, policy-makers and other stakeholders on the future of AI in science and government.
All documents are being co-created and shared openly for further development and reuse.

One of the primary outcomes are a series of White Papers, which will offer an opportunity for ASG as a programme to reflect on:

- learnings using evidence from ASG research,
- key challenges that have emerged,
- recommendations for the future and
- possible calls to action for the wider research community, government, policymakers and the public.

### Partners and projects

- [**The Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)**](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme at the Turing represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives that seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts. 
  - The ASG Community Manager was funded by the ASG and sits in the Reseach Community Management Team hosted under the TPS programme.
  - The Research Application Management group led by Aida Mehonic was piloted under the ASG programme. Alden Conner and Jennifer Ding were involved in the productions of one whitepaper each, while supporting multiple ASG projects as Research Application Managers.
