# ASG White Papers

🎉 Welcome to our repo!

This is where we will track the process of collaboratively authoring the three community-led white papers from the [AI for Science and Government](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) [ASG] research programme.

## Overleaf

A few pointers:

- Each section of the document sits in a separate file (can be found on the left side in Overleaf).
  The sections are **for guidance only** and can be changed as needed.
  Please feel free to edit the document and add/change sections.
- Each section is contained in a **markdown** file.
  It’s mostly plain text with a little markup for bold, italics, links, bullets etc.
  No fancy $\LaTeX$ required.
  Please contact [Achintya Rao](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics) if you need help with formatting.
- For the sake of meaningful `diff`s between versions of the document, please start a new sentence on a new line.
  This practice is sometimes called using “semantic line breaks”.
  Find out more: <https://sembr.org/>.
- Overleaf offers commenting and change-tracking (latter is not active by default).
  Highlighting any text in the source file gives you an option to add a comment.
- Every time you save the file, it recompiles the PDF.
